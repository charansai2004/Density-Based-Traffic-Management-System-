# Single-Road Simulation Results

## Overview
This simulation demonstrates the functionality of the **Density-Based Traffic Management System** for a single road. The system adapts traffic signals dynamically based on real-time vehicle detection using ultrasonic sensors.

## Simulation Scenarios
1. **No Traffic:**
   - Red light remains on, and the timer is off.  
   - Ensures safety and reduces unnecessary energy consumption.  

2. **Low Traffic Density:**  
   - Green light for 5 seconds, followed by a yellow light for 5 seconds.  
   - Countdown timer displays 10 seconds in total.  

3. **High Traffic Density:**  
   - Green light for 10 seconds, followed by a yellow light for 5 seconds.  
   - Countdown timer displays 15 seconds in total.
