# Complete System Simulation Results

## Overview
This simulation showcases the operation of the **Density-Based Traffic Management System** for a four-road intersection. The system dynamically controls traffic signals for each road based on vehicle density, optimizing traffic flow.

## Simulation Scenarios
1. **No Traffic:**
   - **For All Roads:**
     - Red lights remain on for all roads, and timers are off.  
   - **For Single Roads:**
     - Red lights remain on for current road, and timers are off.  
     - Road with no detected vehicles are skipped to reduce wait time.  

2. **Low Traffic Density:**  
   - Green light for 5 seconds, followed by a yellow light for 5 seconds.  
   - Countdown timer displays 10 seconds in total.  

3. **High Traffic Density:**  
   - Green light for 10 seconds, followed by a yellow light for 5 seconds.  
   - Countdown timer displays 15 seconds in total.
