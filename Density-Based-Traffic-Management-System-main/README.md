# Density-Based Traffic Management System

## Overview
This project uses real-time traffic density data to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings, reducing congestion, emissions, and delays. 

### Features
- **Real-time vehicle detection** using ultrasonic sensors.
- **Adaptive traffic lights** for dynamic signal timings.
- **Simulations** for single-road and four-road systems.
- **Hardware implementation** for a complete working prototype.
