## Video Highlights
- **Traffic Density Detection:**  
  Ultrasonic sensors detect the presence of vehicles and calculate traffic density for each road.  
- **Adaptive Signal Timing:**  
  Signal durations dynamically adjust based on low and high-density traffic conditions.  
- **Countdown Display:**  
  TM1637 displays provide real-time countdown timers for drivers.  
- **Efficient Road Management:**  
  Skipping empty roads to reduce congestion and optimize signal flow.
