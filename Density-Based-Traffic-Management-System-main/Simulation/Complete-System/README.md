# Complete System Simulation
This simulation demonstrates the density-based traffic management system for a four-road setup.

After successfully testing a single-lane implementation, the full system was expanded to simulate its operation in a multi-road traffic scenario. The complete project is accessible here. In this simulation, four roads with two ultrasonic sensors each observe them, control LEDs for traffic lights, and monitor a countdown timer for each road. The System then calculates dynamic traffic density for each road, prioritizes busy roads while skipping empty roads, and transitions their signal lights accordingly.
