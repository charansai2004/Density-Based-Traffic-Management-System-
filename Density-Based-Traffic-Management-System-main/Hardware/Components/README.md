# Components Description for Density-Based Traffic Management System

### 1. Arduino Mega 2560
The brain of this traffic signalling system is the central microcontroller, the [Arduino Mega 2560](./Arduino_Mega_2560.png), managing traffic signals on-road intersections. The Arduino Mega in this project collects traffic data from ultrasonic sensors and performs LEDs and seven-segment display operations. With its multiple I/O pins, it suits the needs of a four-road setup. The logic for the signal timing takes into account the crowd at different crossroads. The whole software code for the system is written for the Arduino Mega, which makes it distinctively the mainstay for any embedded traffic signalling project.

### 2. Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
The [Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)](./Ultrasonic_Sensors_(HC-SR04).png) rely on the ultrasonic principle to detect the presence and distance of objects (vehicles). With two sensors for each road, the system can read traffic density, either low traffic density or high traffic density. In real-time, their data leads to a respective traffic signal change. It provides vital insights into adaptive signal timing for reducing congestion and thus minimizes idle time.

### 3. Four Seven-Segment Displays (TM1637)
The [Four Seven-Segment Display (TM1637)](./Four_Seven_Segment_Displays_(TM1637).png) displays indicate the countdown timer for each road, conveying the remaining signal time for drivers. The Arduino Mega controls these displays, changing dynamically based on sensor traffic density readings. An appealing user interface further enhances road safety and predictability.

### 4. LEDs lights (Red, Yellow, Green)
The [LEDs lights (Red, Yellow, Green)](./LED_Lights_(Red,Green,Yellow).png) portray traffic signals and provide clear, colour-coded instructions to drivers to stop, go, or pass. With the changing traffic density, they change in time: green for go, yellow for caution, and red for stop. The ease of integration ensures a smooth and delay-free traffic flow.

### 5. Breadboard and Jumper Wires
The [Breadboard and Jumper Wires](./Breadboard-and-Jumper_Wires.png) are employed in the actual circuit prototyping of the Arduino Mega, sensors, LEDs, and displays. The breadboard makes it easy to design and test the system without having to solder. The jumper wires create stable temporary connections between all the components.
